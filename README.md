# "Unveiling the Impact: Analyzing the Influence of API Weather Data on Flight Rescheduling and Cancellations"
In our collaborative team project, we imported weather data from APIs and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate the impact of specific weather events on flight performance. 

The project focused on examining the impact of a major weather event on flight statuses at the location where the event happened. With meticulous selection, we identified a significant weather occurrence that presented an opportunity to explore its influence on the performance of flights. Through rigorous analysis and data processing, we uncovered compelling results that shed light on the correlation between this specific weather event and flight disruptions. This project aimed to deepen our understanding of how weather conditions can affect the aviation industry, providing valuable insights for airlines, passengers, and stakeholders alike.

Additionally:

1. I demonstrated my proficiency in writing SQL queries within a Python Jupyter Notebook.
2. We established a connection with our PostgreSQL database and seamlessly integrated it into our workflow.
3. We successfully imported data from the PostgreSQL database into pandas dataframes for further analysis.
