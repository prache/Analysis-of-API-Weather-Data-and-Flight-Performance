# Unveiling the Impact: Analyzing the Influence of API Weather Data on Flight Rescheduling and Cancellations during the January 2014 Gulf Coast Winter Storm

In our collaborative team project, we delved into the consequences of a significant weather event that occurred in January 2014 - the Gulf Coast Winter Storm. This storm caused widespread disruptions and severe travel issues in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. With hazardous conditions including heavy snowfall, freezing rain, and sleet catching many people off guard, the storm resulted in injuries and tragically claimed the lives of two individuals. Notably, the storm brought about a maximum snowfall of 25 cm.

Our project aimed to examine the direct impact of this major weather event on flight statuses at the location where it unfolded. By meticulously selecting this specific weather occurrence, we sought to explore its influence on flight performance, including rescheduling and cancellations. Through meticulous analysis, rigorous data processing, and insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), we were able to reveal compelling results that shed light on the correlation between this particular weather event and disruptions in the aviation industry.

Furthermore, the project served as an opportunity for me to demonstrate my proficiency in writing SQL queries within a Python Jupyter Notebook. Leveraging this expertise, we seamlessly established a connection with our PostgreSQL database and integrated it into our workflow. This allowed us to efficiently import relevant data from the database into pandas dataframes, enabling further analysis and exploration.

Overall, our project sought to deepen our understanding of how weather conditions, exemplified by the Gulf Coast Winter Storm, can significantly affect the aviation industry. By providing valuable insights for airlines, passengers, and stakeholders alike, we aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between weather events and flight disruptions.
